BinanceChain
------------

BinanceChain is a blockchain with a flexible set of native assets and pluggable modules. It uses [tendermint](https://tendermint.com) for consensus and app logic is written in golang. With fast block times, a native app layer and no smart contract VM it can conceivably support up to 10,000 tx/s.

This is a fork of [basecoin](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/examples/basecoin) and is already functional as a multi-asset cryptocurrency blockchain; see below for how to use it. The goal is to implement a DEX plugin that will allow for the trading of native asset pairs.

## Overview

* This uses BFT consensus so up to 1/3 of all validator nodes can be rogue or bad.
* Validator nodes are part of the "validator set" so they are known, trusted and controlled by the network.
* Full nodes are not validator nodes, but anyone can get a copy of the whole blockchain and validate it.
* No PoW means block times are very fast.
* UXTO/account does not matter as we just use the [cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/x/bank) bank.
* Features like the DEX will run directly on the node as apps written in golang.

## Getting Started

### Environment setup

If you do not have golang yet, please [install it](https://golang.org/dl) or use brew on macOS: `brew install go` and `brew install dep`.


**Mac & Linux**

```bash
$ export GOPATH=~/go
$ export PATH=~/go/bin:$PATH
$ export BNBCHAINPATH=~/go/src/github.com/BiJie/BinanceChain
$ mkdir -p $BNBCHAINPATH
$ git clone git@github.com:BiJie/BinanceChain.git $BNBCHAINPATH
$ cd $BNBCHAINPATH
$ make get_vendor_deps
$ make install
```

**Windows**

If you are working on windows, `GOPATH` and `PATH` should already be set when you install golang.
You may need add BNBCHAINPATH to the environment variables.

```bat
> md %BNBCHAINPATH%
> git clone git@github.com:BiJie/BinanceChain.git %BNBCHAINPATH%
> cd %BNBCHAINPATH%
> make get_vendor_deps
> make install
```

> If you encounter some network issues when downloading the dependencies, make sure you have configured shadowsocks correctly and switch to global mode. Run `set(win)/export(linux/mac) https_proxy=127.0.0.1:1080` if you still have https issues. 

To test that installation worked, try to run the cli tool:

```bash
$ bnbcli
```

### Start the blockchain

This command will generate a keypair for your node and create the genesis block config:

```bash
$ bnbchaind init --name=xxx
$ cat ~/.bnbchaind/config/genesis.json
```

> ~~If you are working on windows platform, replace all **`'\'`** by **`'/'`** in `~\.bnbchaind\config\config.toml`. Similarly, you need apply the same operation to `~\.bnbcli\config\config.toml` if it exists.~~
> (This is fixed in new version of cosmos)


You may want to check the [Issuing assets](#issuing-assets) section below before you start, but this is how to start the node and begin generating blocks:

```bash
$ bnbchaind start
```

If everything worked you will see blocks being generated around every 1s in your console.

### Reset

When you make a change you probably want to reset your chain, remember to kill the node first.

```bash
$ bnbchaind unsafe_reset_all
```

## Assets

### Issuing assets

For now assets are issued in the genesis block to a particular account, so after `init` and before `start` steps check the genesis config:

```bash
$ cat ~/.bnbchaind/config/genesis.json
{
  "genesis_time": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "chain_id": "test-chain-QP9aAb",
  ...
  "app_state": {
    "accounts": {
        ...
```

In `accounts` you will see an address and a list of coins, which you can edit to provide new coins to an account when you `start` your node for the first time. You should see a very large number of `mycoin` issued to a random key by default.

You can change this key to your own (use `go run cmd/bnbcli/main.go keys list` to see them) and this will assign the `mycoin` to your account on `start`.

### Checking a balance

Start your node, then list your keys as below:

```bash
$ bnbcli keys list
All keys:
pepe    B71E119324558ABA3AE3F5BC854F1225132465A0
you     DEBF30B59A5CD0111FDF4F86664BC063BF450A1A
```

Check a balance with this command, e.g.:

```bash
$ bnbcli account DEBF30B59A5CD0111FDF4F86664BC063BF450A1A
```

Alternatively through http when `bnbcli rest-server` is running. Amounts are returned as decimal numbers in strings.

```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost:1317/balances/cosmosaccaddr173hyu6dtfkrj9vujjhvz2ayehrng64rxq3h4yp | json_pp
{
   "address" : "cosmosaccaddr173hyu6dtfkrj9vujjhvz2ayehrng64rxq3h4yp",
   "balances" : [
      {
         "symbol" : "BNB",
         "free" : "200000000",
         "locked" : "0",
         "frozen" : "0"
      },
      {
         "symbol" : "XYZ",
         "free" : "98999900",
         "locked" : "100",
         "frozen" : "0"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Sending assets

You have to send a transaction to send assets to another address, which is possible with the cli tool:

Make sure `chain-id` is set correctly; you can find it in your `genesis.json`.

```bash
$ bnbcli send --chain-id=test-chain-QP9aAb --name=you --amount=1000mycoin --to=B71E119324558ABA3AE3F5BC854F1225132465A0 --sequence=0
Password to sign with 'you': xxx
Committed at block 88. Hash: 492B08FFE364D389BB508FD3507BBACD3DB58A98
```

You can look at the contents of the tx, use the tx hash above:

```bash
$ bnbcli tx 492B08FFE364D389BB508FD3507BBACD3DB58A98
```

Then you can check the balance of pepe's key to see that he now has 1000 `mycoin`:

```bash
$ bnbcli account B71E119324558ABA3AE3F5BC854F1225132465A0
{
  "type": "16542275FBFAB8",
  "value": {
    "BaseAccount": {
      "address": "B71E119324558ABA3AE3F5BC854F1225132465A0",
      "coins": [
        {
          "denom": "mycoin",
          "amount": 1000
        }
      ],
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

Amounts are represented as ints, so if `mycoin` has a precision of 2 decimal places then pepe now has a balance of 10.00.

## DEX

### Placing an order

```bash
$ bnbcli dex order -i uniqueid1 -l XYZ_BNB -s 1 -p 100000000 -q 100000000 --from me --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID -t 1
```

### Viewing the order book

```bash
$ bnbcli dex show -l XYZ_BNB
```

Alternatively through http when `bnbcli rest-server` is running. Prices and quantities are returned as decimal numbers in strings.

```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost:1317/orderbook/XYZ_BNB | json_pp
{"pair":"XYZ_BNB","orders":[{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"},{"buyQty":"0","buyPrice":"0","sellQty":"0","sellPrice":"0"}]}
```

### Future

#### DEX

The idea for the DEX is that order books will be kept in the global state and matched in the nodes, performing all the logic on chain. This will be implemented as a "plugin" in golang to extend our base coin app.

#### ICO

If we use a native asset (BNB) as an ICO quote currency this will be straightforward as a plugin, but other examples of how to peg ethereum tokens to assets on tendermint chains do exist e.g.
