## NOTICE

This goavro library has been rewritten to correct a large number of
shortcomings:

* https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/issues/71
* https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/issues/72
* https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/issues/81

I ernestly want to replace this library with the newer version, but
there is an API difference: rather than reading from `io.Reader`
streams, decoding reads from byte slices, and rather than writing to
`io.Writer` streams, encoding appends to byte slices. The performance
benefit seems worth the trouble of upgrading: 3x encoding performance
and 4x decoding performance on some hefty payloads used at LinkedIn.

Until the migration is complete, if your program is not able to encode
or decode Avro payloads due to schema issues, or perhaps you are
looking for a more performant implementation, I recommend looking at
the newer goavro engine hosted in a different repository

## Description

Goavro is a golang library that implements encoding and decoding of
Avro data. It provides an interface to encode data directly to
`io.Writer` streams, and decoding data from `io.Reader`
streams. Goavro fully adheres to
[version 1.7.7 of the Avro specification](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/spec.html).

## Usage

Documentation is available via
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/linkedin/goavro?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/linkedin/goavro).

Please see the example programs in the `examples` directory for
reference.

Although the Avro specification defines the terms reader and writer as
library components which read and write Avro data, Go has particular
strong emphasis on what a Reader and Writer are. Namely, it is bad
form to define an interface which shares the same name but uses a
different method signature. In other words, all Reader interfaces
should effectively mirror an `io.Reader`, and all Writer interfaces
should mirror an `io.Writer`. Adherence to this standard is essential
to keep libraries easy to use.

An `io.Reader` reads data from the stream specified at object creation
time into the parameterized slice of bytes and returns both the number
of bytes read and an error. An Avro reader also reads from a stream,
but it is possible to create an Avro reader that can read from one
stream, then read from another, using the same compiled schema. In
other words, an Avro reader puts the schema first, whereas an
`io.Reader` puts the stream first.

To support an Avro reader being able to read from multiple streams,
its API must be different and incompatible with `io.Reader` interface
from the Go standard. Instead, an Avro reader looks more like the
Unmarshal functionality provided by the Go `encoding/json` library.

### Codec interface

Creating a `goavro.Codec` is fast, but ought to be performed exactly
once per Avro schema to process. Once a `Codec` is created, it may be
used multiple times to either decode or encode data.

The `Codec` interface exposes two methods, one to encode data and one
to decode data. They encode directly into an `io.Writer`, and decode
directly from an `io.Reader`.

A particular `Codec` can work with only one Avro schema. However,
there is no practical limit to how many `Codec`s may be created and
used in a program. Internally a `goavro.codec` is merely a namespace
and two function pointers to decode and encode data. Because `codec`s
maintain no state, the same `Codec` can be concurrently used on
different `io` streams as desired.

```Go
    func (c *codec) Decode(r io.Reader) (interface{}, error)
    func (c *codec) Encode(w io.Writer, datum interface{}) error
```

#### Creating a `Codec`

The below is an example of creating a `Codec` from a provided JSON
schema. `Codec`s do not maintain any internal state, and may be used
multiple times on multiple `io.Reader`s, `io.Writer`s, concurrently if
desired.

```Go
    someRecordSchemaJson := `{"type":"record","name":"Foo","fields":[{"name":"field1","type":"int"},{"name":"field2","type":"string","default":"happy"}]}`
    codec, err := goavro.NewCodec(someRecordSchemaJson)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
```

#### Decoding data

The below is a simplified example of decoding binary data to be read
from an `io.Reader` into a single datum using a previously compiled
`Codec`. The `Decode` method of the `Codec` interface may be called
multiple times, each time on the same or on different `io.Reader`
objects.

```Go
    // uses codec created above, and an io.Reader, definition not shown
    datum, err := codec.Decode(r)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
```

#### Encoding data

The below is a simplified example of encoding a single datum into the
Avro binary format using a previously compiled `Codec`. The `Encode`
method of the `Codec` interface may be called multiple times, each
time on the same or on different `io.Writer` objects.

```Go
    // uses codec created above, an io.Writer, definition not shown,
    // and some data
    err := codec.Encode(w, datum)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
```

Another example, this time leveraging `bufio.Writer`:

```Go
    // Encoding data using bufio.Writer to buffer the writes
    // during data encoding:

    func encodeWithBufferedWriter(c Codec, w io.Writer, datum interface{}) error {
        bw := bufio.NewWriter(w)
        err := c.Encode(bw, datum)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        return bw.Flush()
    }

    err := encodeWithBufferedWriter(codec, w, datum)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
```

### Reader and Writer helper types

The `Codec` interface provides means to encode and decode any Avro
data, but a number of additional helper types are provided to handle
streaming of Avro data.

See the example programs `examples/file/reader.go` and
`examples/file/writer.go` for more context:

This example wraps the provided `io.Reader` in a `bufio.Reader` and
dumps the data to standard output.

```Go
func dumpReader(r io.Reader) {
	fr, err := goavro.NewReader(goavro.BufferFromReader(r))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("cannot create Reader: ", err)
	}
	defer func() {
		if err := fr.Close(); err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	}()

	for fr.Scan() {
		datum, err := fr.Read()
		if err != nil {
			log.Println("cannot read datum: ", err)
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(datum)
	}
}
```

This example buffers the provided `io.Writer` in a `bufio.Writer`, and
writes some data to the stream.

```Go
func makeSomeData(w io.Writer) error {
    recordSchema := `
    {
      "type": "record",
      "name": "example",
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "string",
          "name": "username"
        },
        {
          "type": "string",
          "name": "comment"
        },
        {
          "type": "long",
          "name": "timestamp"
        }
      ]
    }
    `
	fw, err := goavro.NewWriter(
		goavro.BlockSize(13), // example; default is 10
		goavro.Compression(goavro.CompressionSnappy), // default is CompressionNull
		goavro.WriterSchema(recordSchema),
		goavro.ToWriter(w))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("cannot create Writer: ", err)
	}
	defer fw.Close()

    // make a record instance using the same schema
	someRecord, err := goavro.NewRecord(goavro.RecordSchema(recordSchema))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	// identify field name to set datum for
	someRecord.Set("username", "Aquaman")
	someRecord.Set("comment", "The Atlantic is oddly cold this morning!")
	// you can fully qualify the field name
	someRecord.Set("com.example.timestamp", int64(1082196484))
    fw.Write(someRecord)

    // make another record
	someRecord, err = goavro.NewRecord(goavro.RecordSchema(recordSchema))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	someRecord.Set("username", "Batman")
	someRecord.Set("comment", "Who are all of these crazies?")
	someRecord.Set("com.example.timestamp", int64(1427383430))
    fw.Write(someRecord)
}
```

## Limitations

Goavro is a fully featured encoder and decoder of binary Avro data. It
fully supports recursive data structures, unions, and namespacing. It
does have a few limitations that have yet to be implemented.

### Aliases

The Avro specification allows an implementation to optionally map a
writer's schema to a reader's schema using aliases. Although goavro
can compile schemas with aliases, it does not yet implement this
feature.

### JSON Encoding

The Avro Data Serialization format describes two encodings: binary and
JSON. Goavro only implements binary encoding of data streams, because
that is what most applications need.

> Most applications will use the binary encoding, as it is smaller and
> faster. But, for debugging and web-based applications, the JSON
> encoding may sometimes be appropriate.

Note that data schemas are always encoded using JSON, as per the
specification.

### Kafka Streams

[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) is the reason goavro was
written. Similar to Avro Object Container Files being a layer of
abstraction above Avro Data Serialization format, Kafka's use of Avro
is a layer of abstraction that also sits above Avro Data Serialization
format, but has its own schema. Like Avro Object Container Files, this
has been implemented but removed until the API can be improved.

### Default maximum length of `String` and `Bytes` fields

Because the way we currently decode String and Bytes fields is entirely
stateless an Avro file could specify that a String or Bytes field is
extremely large and there would be no way for the decode function to know
anything was wrong. Instead of checking the available system memory on
every decode operation, we've instead decided to opt for what we believe
to be a sane default (`math.MaxInt32` or ~2.2GB) but leave that variable exported so that a user
can change the variable if they need to exceed this limit.
